# Technical test Withings

With more time I will seperate all the curl action I do in the code to don't repeat code.
This PHP script was build with PHP 8.1 and Curl.
Make to have PHP 8.1 and Curl installed.

To be able to run the script you will have to change the `script.php` permision
    
```bash
//Change the permision of the script.php file to be able to run it.
$> chmod +x script.php

//Run the script.
$> ./script.php
```
